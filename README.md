# MCConnect

MCConnect is a further development of my [other mc-stats site.](https://github.com/Tobias-Auer/Full-Stack/tree/main/minecraft_webserver)


This will be version 2.0, with an improved and optimized backend with Postgres.
Unlike before, this program no longer needs to run on the same file system as the Minecraft server.
In addition, the website will support multiple Minecraft servers. 

Anyone will be able to add their own Minecraft server to this server with a simple, lightweight minecraft plugin.

Preview:
- Custom Server page for everyone

- Player list and status information for every player ever joined the server

- Detailed player statistics for every player

- Privacy friendly and easy login for every player to view and change personal data:
